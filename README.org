* helm-template-mode
A major mode for working with helm template files.

This package is supposed to be a small but nice package for setting up working with helm files and make integration with [[https://github.com/mrjosh/helm-ls/tree/master][helm-ls]] easier.
** TODOs
- Integrate [[https://github.com/mrjosh/helm-ls/tree/master][helm-ls]]
